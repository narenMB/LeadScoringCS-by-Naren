# LeadScoringCS-by-Naren
## X Education(Introduction); 
   An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

## Goal :
   Once these leads are obtained through various channels; our sales teams cover all bases through vital outreaches via phone calls or emails aimed at converting them into paying clients. Currently, we are only able to achieve 30% conversion rates. 
   To improve the outcomes of this process, X Education aims to identify and focus on “Hot Leads,” which are established through a reliable lead scoring model. This process assigns high scores to more promising leads; ultimately aiming for an 80% conversion rate for optimal success. 

## Approach :
The analytical process begins with cleansing the data while tackling missing values systematically. 
We will then work up with robust exploratory analysis techniques like univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, create dummy variables coupled with feature scaling before building a Logistic Regression model that can efficiently evaluate elements such as sensitivity and specificity as well as precision and recall. 
In conclusion, Our primary objective is not about attaining great numbers per se but mainly centered on better educational interactions that are lasting in beneficial ways between student and instructor at X Education.
